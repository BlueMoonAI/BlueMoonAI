***Tested and works!**

Note: if the Crash Happen in BlueMoon AI while executing try the following:
```shell
!python launcher.py --share  --attention-split --disable-offload-from-vram --always-high-vram
```
### Linux (Using Anaconda)

If you want to use Anaconda/Miniconda, you can

    git clone https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI.git
    cd BlueMoonAI
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate BlueMoonAI
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then download the models: download [default models](#default-models) to the folder "BlueMoonAI\models\checkpoints". **Or let BlueMoonAI automatically download the models** using the launcher:

    conda activate BlueMoonAI
    python launcher.py

Or if you want to open a remote port, use

    conda activate BlueMoonAI
    python launcher.py --listen

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

### Linux (Using Python Venv)

Your Linux needs to have **Python 3.10** installed, and let's say your Python can be called with command **python3** with your venv system working, you can

    git clone https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI.git
    cd BlueMoonAI
    python3 -m venv BlueMoonAI_env
    source BlueMoonAI_env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python launcher.py

Or if you want to open a remote port, use

    source BlueMoonAI_env/bin/activate
    python launcher.py --listen

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

### Linux (Using native system Python)

If you know what you are doing, and your Linux already has **Python 3.10** installed, and your Python can be called with command **python3** (and Pip with **pip3**), you can

    git clone https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI.git
    cd BlueMoonAI
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

See the above sections for model downloads. You can launch the software with:

    python3 launcher.py

Or if you want to open a remote port, use

    python3 launcher.py --listen

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

you can also change the presets on `advanced>Custom>Presets` section dynamically. and add more presets in [presets](./presets/) folder.

### Linux (AMD GPUs)

Same with the above instructions. You need to change torch to AMD version

    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio torchtext functorch xformers 
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6

AMD is not intensively tested, however. The AMD support is in beta.

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

### Windows(AMD GPUs)

Same with the above instructions. You need to change torch to AMD version

    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio torchtext functorch xformers 
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

### Mac

Mac is not intensively tested. Below is an unofficial guideline for using Mac. You can discuss problems [here](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/).

You can install BlueMoonAI on Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2 or M3) with macOS 'Catalina' or a newer version. BlueMoonAI runs on Apple Silicon computers via [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) MPS device acceleration.
Mac Silicon computers don't come with a dedicated graphics card, resulting in significantly longer image processing times compared to computers with dedicated graphics cards.

1. Install the conda package manager and pytorch nightly. Read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide for instructions. Make sure pytorch recognizes your MPS device.
2. Open the macOS Terminal app and clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI.git`.
3. Change to the new BlueMoonAI directory, `cd BlueMoonAI`.
4. Create a new conda environment, `conda env create -f environment.yaml`.
5. Activate your new conda environment, `conda activate BlueMoonAI`.
6. Install the packages required by BlueMoonAI, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. Launch BlueMoonAI by running `python launcher.py`. (Some Mac users may need `python launcher.py --disable-offload-from-vram` to speed up model loading/unloading.) The first time you run BlueMoonAI, it will automatically download the Stable Diffusion SDXL models and will take a significant time, depending on your internet connection.

Checkout the [CMD flags](#all-cmd-flags) for more options.

## Default Models
<a name="models"></a>
![image](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/assets/138022882/eda715c0-0682-48a4-bdc7-81299eefcd6a)

Given different goals, the default models and configs of BlueMoonAI is different:

| Task | args | Main Model | Refiner | Config |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| General |  | [juggernautXL v7_RunDiffusion](https://huggingface.co/BlueMoonAI/Models/resolve/main/juggernautXL_version7Rundiffusion.safetensors) | not used | [here](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/blob/main/modules/path.py) |
| Realistic | --preset realistic | [realistic_stock_photo](https://huggingface.co/BlueMoonAI/Models/resolve/main/realisticStockPhoto_v10.safetensors) | not used | [here](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/blob/main/presets/realistic.json) |
| Anime |--preset anime | [bluepencil_v300](https://huggingface.co/BlueMoonAI/Models/resolve/main/bluePencilXL_v300.safetensors) | [dreamsharper_v8](https://huggingface.co/BlueMoonAI/Models/resolve/main/DreamShaper_8_pruned.safetensors) (SD1.5) | [here](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/blob/main/presets/anime.json) |

Note that the download is **automatic** - you do not need to do anything if the internet connection is okay. However, you can download them manually if you (or move them from somewhere else) have your own preparation.

The default models are downloaded to `BlueMoonAI\models\checkpoints` folder. You can also download them manually and put them in the folder. you can refer this at [Model Downloads](#model-downloads)

you can change the models like this if the model downloaded does not appear make sure to click refresh and check it will appear
![image](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/assets/138022882/e92915a2-d347-4881-9f2d-abdddaaaf561)


## Presets
you can change presets on custom tab which is located in advanced checkbox
![image](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/assets/138022882/5085354f-f162-4ce4-b045-02aad7828dcd)

and to add more presets you can do it by adding it in [presets](./presets/) folder.

## Model Downloads 
You can easily download a model's checkpoint or LoRAs from Civit.AI or Huggingface by using the provided URL.

![image](https://github.com/BlueMoonAI/BlueMoonAI/assets/138022882/e1eab451-d411-464b-a76b-4c0e2f21419f)

**Note:- Ensure you use the provided downloadable URL for successful downloads. Using any other URL may result in non-functionality.**

## Customization

After the first time you run BlueMoonAI, a config file will be generated at `BlueMoonAI\config.txt`. This file can be edited for changing the model path or default parameters.

For example, an edited `BlueMoonAI\config.txt` (this file will be generated after the first launch) may look like this:

```json
{
    "path_checkpoints": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\checkpoints",
    "path_loras": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\loras",
    "path_embeddings": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\embeddings",
    "path_vae_approx": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\vae_approx",
    "path_upscale_models": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\upscale_models",
    "path_inpaint": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\inpaint",
    "path_controlnet": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\controlnet",
    "path_clip_vision": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\clip_vision",
    "path_BlueMoonAI_expansion": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\models\\prompt_expansion\\BlueMoonAI_expansion",
    "path_outputs": "D:\\BlueMoonAI\\outputs",
    "default_model": "realisticStockPhoto_v10.safetensors",
    "default_refiner": "",
    "default_loras": [["lora_filename_1.safetensors", 0.5], ["lora_filename_2.safetensors", 0.5]],
    "default_cfg_scale": 3.0,
    "default_sampler": "dpmpp_2m",
    "default_scheduler": "karras",
    "default_negative_prompt": "low quality",
    "default_positive_prompt": "",
    "default_styles": [
        "BlueMoonAI V1",
        "BlueMoonAI Photograph",
        "BlueMoonAI Negative"
    ]
}
```

Many other keys, formats, and examples are in `BlueMoonAI\config_settings.txt` (this file will be generated after the first launch).

Consider twice before you really change the config. If you find yourself breaking things, just delete `BlueMoonAI\config.txt`. BlueMoonAI will go back to default.
also you can turn off the automatic updates by changing it in `settings.json` file

```json
{
  "AUTOUPDATE": "False"
}
```

- Anime Preset:
  ```bash
  python launcher.py --preset anime
  ```
- Realistic Preset:
```bash
python launcher.py --preset realistic
```

## Localization/Translation

**We need your help!** Please help with translating BlueMoonAI to international languages.

You can put json files in the `language` folder to translate the user interface.

For example, below is the content of `BlueMoonAI/language/example.json`:

```json
{
  "Preview": "Prévisualisation",
  "Gallery": "Galerie",
  "Generate": "Générer",
  "Skip": "Passer",
  "Stop": "Arrêter",
  "Input Image": "Image d'entrée",
  "Advanced": "Avancé",
  "Upscale or Variation": "Agrandir ou Variante",
  "Image Prompt": "Incitation d'image",
  "Inpaint or Outpaint": "Retouche ou Extrapolation",
  "Drag above image to here": "Faites glisser l'image ci-dessus ici",
  "Upscale or Variation:": "Agrandir ou Variante:",
  "Disabled": "Désactivé",
  "Vary (Subtle)": "Variante (Subtile)",
  "Vary (Strong)": "Variante (Fort)",
  "Upscale (1.5x)": "Agrandir (1.5x)",
  "Upscale (2x)": "Agrandir (2x)",
  "Upscale (Fast 2x)": "Agrandir (Rapide 2x)",
  "\ud83d\udcd4 Document": "\uD83D\uDCD4 Document",
  "Image": "Image",
  "Outpaint Expansion Direction:": "Direction d'extension de la extrapolation:",
  "* Powered by BlueMoon AI Inpaint Engine": "* Propulsé par BlueMoon AI Inpaint Engine",
  "BlueMoon AI Enhance": "BlueMoon AI Améliorer",
  "BlueMoon AI Cinematic": "BlueMoon AI Cinématique",
  "BlueMoon AI Sharp": "BlueMoon AI Net"
}

```

If you add `--language example` arg, BlueMoonAI will read `BlueMoonAI/language/example.json` to translate the UI.

For practical translation, you may create your own file like `BlueMoonAI/language/jp.json` or `BlueMoonAI/language/cn.json` and then use flag `--language jp` or `--language cn`. Apparently, these files do not exist now. **We need your help to create these files!**



Note that if no `--language` is given and at the same time `BlueMoonAI/language/default.json` exists, BlueMoonAI will always load `BlueMoonAI/language/default.json` for translation. By default, the file `BlueMoonAI/language/default.json` does not exist.


## Happy Creativity! ❤️
